There are a several factors that I would take into consideration in case of a zombie pandemic.

Main models;

- ZOMBIES
  -Attack
  \*Agrresiveness (how many people get attaked from a zombie)

  -Movement speed (how fast a zombie moves)

  -Pain tolerence (what could happen when zombie gets attacked from people)
  *Reanimate (cure and becomes zombie again)
  *Death

- PEOPLE
  -Infectees
  *death
  *medicine required

  -convert to zombies

  -Attack (the way to attack zombies)
  *Fire arm
  *Bombs
  \*Traps

  -Cure
  \*Hospital
